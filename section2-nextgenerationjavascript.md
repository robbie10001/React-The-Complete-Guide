### Next Generation Javascript 

#### Understanding let and const 

let and const are different ways of creating variables. They were introduced in es6. 

let - is used for variable values. We use let if we want to create a variable that is going to change value.

const - is used when we create a variable whos value we want to keep the same. We are unable to reassign this variable value. 

#### Arrow Functions 

arrow functions are a different syntax for creating javascript functions. The syntax is the following. 

const robbie = () => {
    ...
}

1. We have the variable declaration followed by the constant we are assigning that variable to. 

2. We have the equal sign. 

3. we have the arguments we pass in 

4. we have the arrow 

5. we having the curly braces.

The arrow function solves a lot of the problems with the 'this' keyword that we have in javascript. When we use 'this' within an arrow function, it will always keep its context and not change it surprisingly within our runtime environment.
